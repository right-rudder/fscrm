### **3. Keep Your CFIs' Schedules Busy, Hire More CFIs, and Grow Your Flight School!**

To grow your flight school, you need more Certified Flight Instructors (CFIs). The key to achieving this is retaining students and facilitating their own certification as CFIs. Our Flight School CRM helps maintain customer relationships after their initial discovery flight, expanding your pool of potential CFIs.

Many marketing agencies don't grasp the nuances of the pilot training industry, often resorting to generic website templates. We at Right Rudder Marketing, a pilot-owned digital marketing agency, are specialists in this field. We understand what flight schools need.

Our Flight School Marketing System, centered around our robust CRM, is an affordable package that encompasses essential services such as website design, SEO, and online advertising. The Flight School CRM is an indispensable tool in this process, streamlining marketing efforts and increasing profitability.

We aim to assist you in booking more discovery flights, increase your profits, and provide consistent work for your CFIs. The FSCRM is crucial to achieving these objectives.
